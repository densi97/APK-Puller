# APK-Puller
### This little python script makes it easy to pull the apk of the desired app to your PC.

### Prerequisites

1. You need to have [adb](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb) installed.
2. [pure-python-adb](https://pypi.org/project/pure-python-adb/)

Just plug in your Phone and execute the script. You will be asked which device should be used (normally there will just be one).
After that you need to enter the name of the App you want to download and it will present you a list with apps which are installed on the system and match your search.
You can choose the one you want and then the script will automatically download the right apk of your app.
